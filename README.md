# System Programming


In order to compile this program, I created a __makefile__.

To compile the code you have to type **make** within this folder.

In order to run this program, you can use the same commands as the sample used in the project description.

./workerDB small.txt

or the name of the input file from which to gather the worker's information.

I also added a larger employees file to test the code.  

./workerDB large.txt
